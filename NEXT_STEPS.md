## Phase 1: Design & Pattern Preparation

- [ ] **Finalize seated-posture pattern**
  - Shorten front panels by 2–4 inches (measure from intended wearer's seated torso).
  - Extend back panel by 3–6 inches below front panel.
  - Adjust sleeve length: measure from seated shoulder to wrist (typically 1–2 inches shorter than standing measurement).
  - Widen underarm gussets by 0.5–1 inch.
  - Reduce shoulder seam width by 0.5–1 inch (account for harness/straps).
  - Mark high-wear zones (back, underarms, shoulders) on pattern.

- [ ] **Verify pattern fit** (optional mock-up)
  - Cut a muslin test garment using the adjusted pattern.
  - Fit on intended wearer in seated position.
  - Mark pressure points, gaps, or fit issues.
  - Adjust pattern as needed before cutting final fabrics.

- [ ] **Prepare pattern pieces for cutting**
  - Transfer pattern to pattern paper or cardstock.
  - Label each piece (back, front, sleeve, underarm gusset, etc.).
  - Mark grain lines and seam allowances (0.5" throughout).
  - Indicate which pieces use nylon ripstop (high-wear) vs. polyester ripstop (lower-stress).
