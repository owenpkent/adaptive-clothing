## Construction Notes (Specific to Build 1)
- **No Baffles Needed**: Since we are using Climashield Apex, skip the baffle construction phase.
- **Fleece Lining**: The microfleece lining adds bulk compared to nylon taffeta. Ensure the pattern accounts for this slight loft increase.
- **Hybrid Ripstop**: The MTN XL fabric is tougher than standard ripstop. Use a fresh Microtex or Jeans needle (90/14) if the standard Universal (80/12) struggles.
